Commit. In the description, say "add class of clickable to every RH area, add simple eventListener to class of clickable, test with simple console log".
Coffee!
TCS piece 2.

Create function that saves the user input to the page and to local storage.
Think this through in detail: 
1. How to render to local storage.
2. How to retrieve from local storage.
Think about the order of the code. When in the running of the programme do you want to have retrieval? Presumably at the start.
And when do you want to have set to local, presumably only when pressing save?
But this this through and check.
Short break.

Read through the documentation Anthony sent, specifically on get hour (I think).
Work out how to link the real time to the rows. You have given the rows dataset values, so you could use these.
Work out a way, possibly, but not definitely, using an if statement, of making past hours grey, current hour red and future hours green.

Persist events between renders of a page? Make sure that on refresh, it doesn't completely refresh but retrieves from local storage. Refer to week 6 day 3. You will probably need to use .val to capture the user input in the text area. See link sent by BCS assistant.

Further styling of the diary entry table. Can it look nicer with borders, etc.?
If you've set up the data attributes correctly, you can target them in the CSS.

Add some sort of hover effect on the save area so that it will be clearer for the user when they have saved.
