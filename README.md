# Planner-App
Week 7 Challenge

Further practice with JavaScript
## Description
I wanted to create a daily planner that could be used for managing time effectively.
I wanted the daily planner to show the current day.
I wanted the daily planner to use colours to distinguish between the current hour, previous hours and future hours.
I wanted the planner to be able to accept user input into the middle columns and be able to be saved.
I wanted the planner to store the user input information into local storage such that it would continue to appear on refresh.
I wanted to practise use of jQuery to achieve this, especially functions, the use of .on('click'), moment.js and local storage.
I wanted to deploy my finished product and check it had no errors.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
When the website is viewed, the user can see today's date, space to commit diary entries for each hour between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and where to click to save.
