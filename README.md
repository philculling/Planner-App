Week 7 Challenge

Create 8 more rows!
Commit.
C and TCS piece 1.
Research textarea.

Check train times.
Add simple text to the LH columns for the hours.
Add a data-attribute to each ROW which tells you the hour the row represents. Laura says you can do this directly in the html.

Sh.
Make the middle columns something you can input into, probably using textareas.

Add "Save", or an image as in the demo, to the RH columns.

Add an eventListener to the RH columns you can click on to save. The on click will call a function.
TCS piece 2.

Create function that saves the user input to the page and to local storage.

Explore get hour (I think!) from what Anthony showed us from the documentation on moment to work out how to link the real time to the numbers displayed in the LH column,
Then work out a way, probably using an if statement, of making past hours grey, current hour red and future hours green.
But how do we link that with simple text?

Persist events between renders of a page? Make sure that on refresh, it doesn't completely refresh but retrieves from local storage. Refer to week 6 day 3. You will probably need to use .val to capture the user input in the text area. See link sent by BCS assistant.
