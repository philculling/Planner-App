# Planner-App
Week 7 Challenge

1:30 LFC. but continue coding.
3:30 - 5 Back to week 6?
5 Tutor meeting.
Monday evening: speak to Rebecca.

Find a previous activity, ideally a demonstrator one, that uses data attributes to manipulate code.
Work out how to link the real time to the rows. You have given the rows dataset values, so you could use these.

Get rid of "will be emptied for user" from the html.

Work out a way, possibly, but not definitely, using an if statement, of making past hours grey, current hour red and future hours green.

As time allows:
Further styling of the diary entry table. Can it look nicer with borders, etc.?
If you've set up the data attributes correctly, you can target them in the CSS.

Add some sort of hover effect on the save area so that it will be clearer for the user when they have saved.

REAL README STARTS HERE:

Further practice with JavaScript
## Description
I wanted to create a daily planner that could be used for managing time effectively.
I wanted the daily planner to show the current day.
I wanted the daily planner to use colours to distinguish between the current hour, previous hours and future hours.
I wanted the planner to be able to accept user input into the middle columns and be able to be saved.
I wanted the planner to store the user input information into local storage such that it would continue to appear on refresh.
I wanted to practise use of jQuery to achieve this, especially functions, the use of .on('click'), moment.js and local storage.
I wanted to deploy my finished product and check it had no errors.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
When the website is viewed, the user can see today's date, space to commit diary entries for each hour between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and where to click to save.
