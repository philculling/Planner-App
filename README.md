Week 7 Challenge

Sunday morning: revise week 6 work in preparation for tutor meeting, not necessarily for the whole morning.
Sunday afternoon: 1:30 LFC. Continue coding while watching.
Don't get bogged down in week 6 work, continue with this.
Monday evening: speak to Rebecca.

Write a function that will retrieve from local storage and put back in the right place. You will need to have something like you had in last week's challenge so that it doesn't get confused when it's empty. Putting in the right place will be challenging.

Once done:
Repeat the above to have 9 ids for all 9 user inputs.
Have 9 variables to target all 9 user inputs.
Update the functions as appropriate.

TCS piece 3.

Read through the documentation Anthony sent, specifically on get hour (I think).
Work out how to link the real time to the rows. You have given the rows dataset values, so you could use these.
Work out a way, possibly, but not definitely, using an if statement, of making past hours grey, current hour red and future hours green.

Further styling of the diary entry table. Can it look nicer with borders, etc.?
If you've set up the data attributes correctly, you can target them in the CSS.

Add some sort of hover effect on the save area so that it will be clearer for the user when they have saved.
