Lunch?

Add "Save", or an image as in the demo, to the RH columns.
TCS piece 2.

Add an eventListener to the RH columns you can click on to save. The on click will call a function.
Possibly divert to week 6 work?

Create function that saves the user input to the page and to local storage.

Explore get hour (I think!) from what Anthony showed us from the documentation on moment to work out how to link the real time to the rows. You have given the rows dataset values, so you could use these.
Work out a way, possibly, but not definitely, using an if statement, of making past hours grey, current hour red and future hours green.

Persist events between renders of a page? Make sure that on refresh, it doesn't completely refresh but retrieves from local storage. Refer to week 6 day 3. You will probably need to use .val to capture the user input in the text area. See link sent by BCS assistant.
